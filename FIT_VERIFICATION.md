# FIT File Verification Guide

## Yes! The CLASS/COMBAT mode IS recorded to the FIT file! ✅

### What Gets Recorded:

1. **`training_mode` field** (Field ID: 0)
   - Records every second during activity
   - Value: 0 = CLASS, 1 = COMBAT
   - Type: UINT8 (record-level)
   - This creates a time series of your mode throughout the workout

2. **`primary_mode` field** (Field ID: 1)  
   - Records once per session
   - Value: Initial mode when activity started
   - Type: UINT8 (session-level)
   - Summary field for the entire activity

### How to Verify FIT Recording:

#### Method 1: Simulator Testing
1. Start simulator with the app
2. Start an activity (e.g., Run)
3. Toggle between CLASS/COMBAT with LAP button
4. Stop and save the activity
5. Check the console output for FIT field creation messages

#### Method 2: Real Device Testing
1. Install on your Garmin device
2. Record a real workout, switching modes
3. Sync to Garmin Connect
4. Download the FIT file from Garmin Connect
5. Use FIT file analyzer to view custom fields

#### Method 3: FIT File Analysis Tools

**Online FIT Analyzer:**
- https://www.fitfileviewer.com/
- Upload your FIT file
- Look for custom fields: `training_mode` and `primary_mode`

**Command Line (fitdump):**
```bash
# Install fitdump
pip install fitparse

# Analyze FIT file
fitdump activity.fit | grep -A5 "training_mode"
```

### Expected FIT Data Example:

```
Record Messages (every second):
Time: 00:00:01 - training_mode: 0 (CLASS)
Time: 00:00:02 - training_mode: 0 (CLASS)
Time: 00:00:03 - training_mode: 0 (CLASS)
[User presses LAP]
Time: 00:00:04 - training_mode: 1 (COMBAT)
Time: 00:00:05 - training_mode: 1 (COMBAT)
...

Session Summary:
primary_mode: 0 (Started in CLASS mode)
```

### What This Enables:

1. **Post-Workout Analysis**:
   - Total time in CLASS vs COMBAT
   - Mode transitions during workout
   - Training intensity patterns

2. **Long-term Tracking**:
   - Weekly/monthly CLASS vs COMBAT ratio
   - Training balance over time
   - Identify overtraining patterns

3. **Integration Possibilities**:
   - Export to training analysis tools
   - Create custom reports
   - Share training data with coaches

### Troubleshooting:

**If FIT fields don't appear:**
1. Ensure manifest.xml has `<iq:uses-permission id="FitContributor"/>`
2. Check console for "FIT field creation failed" messages
3. Some older devices may not support FitContributor
4. Fields only record during active workout (not in menu)

**Testing Tip:**
The easiest way to verify is to:
1. Record a 1-minute test activity
2. Switch modes 2-3 times with LAP
3. Save activity
4. Check Garmin Connect for the activity file
5. Download Original file (FIT format)
6. Open in FIT viewer to see custom fields

### Current Implementation:
✅ FIT recording is ACTIVE in version 1.0.0
✅ Both record-level and session-level fields implemented
✅ Compatible with all devices that support FitContributor
✅ No additional setup required - it just works!
