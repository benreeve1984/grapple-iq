# Store Description (3,847 characters)

Transform your martial arts training with Grapple IQ - the first data field designed specifically for combat sports athletes who want to track the quality of their training, not just the quantity.

## THE PROBLEM WE SOLVE
Every grappler knows the difference between drilling techniques and live sparring, but your fitness tracker doesn't. Until now, your watch treats 60 minutes of light technical work the same as 60 minutes of intense rolling. Grapple IQ changes that.

## TWO DISTINCT TRAINING MODES

**DRILL MODE** - Technical Training
Perfect for:
• Learning new techniques
• Positional drilling
• Flow rolling
• Warm-ups and cool-downs
• Technique refinement
• Partner drills

**COMBAT MODE** - Live Training
Perfect for:
• Live sparring/rolling
• Competition rounds
• Intense positional sparring
• Shark tank sessions
• Competition preparation
• High-intensity rounds

## SIMPLE, POWERFUL FEATURES

**One-Touch Mode Switching**
Press the LAP button on your watch to instantly toggle between DRILL and COMBAT modes. No menu navigation, no interrupting your training. Just press and go.

**Real-Time Feedback**
• Clear display shows current mode
• Vibration confirms mode changes
• Works seamlessly during active training
• No need to look at your watch - feel the feedback

**Training Data That Matters**
Grapple IQ records your training modes directly to your activity's FIT file, allowing you to:
• Track time spent drilling vs sparring
• Analyze training intensity patterns
• Monitor weekly/monthly training balance
• Identify overtraining risks
• Optimize technical vs live training ratio

## PERFECT FOR

• Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu practitioners
• MMA fighters
• Wrestlers (all styles)
• Judoka
• Boxers and kickboxers
• Muay Thai fighters
• Submission grapplers
• Any martial artist who separates technical and live training

## EASY SETUP

1. Install Grapple IQ from the Connect IQ Store
2. Add it to any data screen in your preferred activity profile
3. Start your workout - begins in DRILL mode
4. Press LAP to switch to COMBAT when you start live rounds
5. Review your training breakdown in Garmin Connect after class

## OPTIMIZED DISPLAY

Works perfectly as a single data field or combined with other metrics:
• Large, clear text in single-field mode
• Scales appropriately for multi-field layouts
• Recommended 4-field setup: Grapple IQ + Heart Rate + Timer + Lap Time

## WHY GRAPPLE IQ?

**Built by Grapplers, For Grapplers**
We understand that a 2-hour BJJ class isn't 2 hours of the same intensity. We built Grapple IQ because we needed it ourselves.

**Future-Proof Your Training Data**
Every training session is permanently recorded with mode data, building a comprehensive picture of your training patterns over time.

**Coach-Friendly**
Share your training data with coaches to show you're following prescribed training intensities and technical/live ratios.

**Recovery Optimization**
Better data means better recovery planning. Know exactly how much high-intensity work you've done this week.
